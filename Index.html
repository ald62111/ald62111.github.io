<h1>
<span>Dear Chick-fil-A, I will</span>
<span><i>never</i></span>
<span>forgive you for taking away high school BOGO</span>
</h1>

<p>BOGO, for those of you who don't know, was a deal Chick-fil-A used to have for high school and college students that allowed them to get 
TWO WHOLE MEALS for the price of one. You got 2 entrees, 2 fries, 2 drinks, you even got twice the amount of sauces you would normally get 
no questions asked. Who needs two drinks!!!? No one is the answer, but Chick-fil-A gives you two drinks because they know how to make you happy 
in ways you wouldn't even imagine.</p>

<p>But, in all seriousness, Chick fil a bogo was one of the best periods of my life. Meeting up with anywhere from two to 6 of my best friedns, eating absurd amounts of food
for one sitting and doing anything from having gang fights to going ding dong ditching. I forged bonds and memories that will last a lifetime during BOGO, while also saving
money on good quality food. I miss BOGO dearly and nothing will ever be the same. For that reason, Chick Fil A, I will never forgive you, and I kind of hate you. But I don't
hate you all the way, just because you're so, so good. I'm still mad though, so remember that.</p>
<p>For the sake of reminiscing, I'm just gonna share a few of my memories from BOGO.</p>

The mountain of fries we made at our last bogo. A bitter sweet image that I will forever hold close to my heart.
